                                                                start stop ec2 instance lambda python:-
                                                                =======================================

  ->Firstly create an EC2 ubuntu instance
  
  ->Then open sevice and search lambda
  
  ->Create a function 
  
  ->CHOOSE Author from Scratch,Then give function name like STARTSTOPINSTANCE 
  
  ->Then open a new tab and and open aws website and open IAM/ROLE
  
  ->Create a role first choose AWS services(Ec2,Lambda and others)
  
  ->Then choose a use case Lambda and click next permission
  
  ->Then search AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole and AmazonEC2FullAccess select it both
  
  ->Then click next tag ,click next review
  
  ->Then role name = lambdaEC2Schedule
  
  ->Then Role Description = Allows Lambda functions to Start and Stop EC2 instance
  
  ->Then again come to EC2 tab and click Change default execution role .
  
  ->Then select use an existing role
  
  ->and select your language in which language you ant to erite a code so i select a python
  
  ->Then select dropdown refresh and select what role you created in IAM like lambdaEC2Schedule will come and 
     then click create function.

   ->then your STARTSTOPINSTANCE function will create.
   
   ->then go with code source and you see lamda_fuction.py file are visible ,
       so open lambda_function file and write a code
       


import json
import boto3

region ='ap-south-1'
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2',region_name=region)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    instances = event["instances"].split(',')
    action = event["action"]
    
    if action == 'Start':
        print("STARTing your instances" + str(instances))
        ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=instances)
        response = "Successfully started instances: "+str(instances)
    elif action =='Stop':
        print("STOPing your instances"+ str(instances))
        ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=instances)
        response = "Successfully stopped instances: "+str(instances)
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps(response)
    }




 


  ->Then you see Test button near test button you will see a dropdown
     so open dropdown and click configure test event.
     
  ->create new test events
  
  ->event name startEC2
  
  ->write a new code here and also first copy your instance id what instance you create ,
     copy your instance code,an in this program i cretae 2 instance so i copy both of two instances 
     
      write in our code.

StartEC2 =(code is ):-
------------------------

{
  "instances": "i-0cb0fb15df8cd0039,i-06382971de6ce982f",
  "action": "Start"
} 


  ->And now we create again new configure test event 
   ->this time event name is =StopEC2
   

stopEC2=(code is) :-
------------------

{
  "instances": "i-0cb0fb15df8cd0039,i-06382971de6ce982f",
  "action": "Stop"
}



  ->then go to test button and choose StopEC2 and deploy it before deploy please save it code then deploy
    after deploy code test button press and you will see your instance will stopped rightnow  so go your EC2 
     instance and check your instance will stopping
   
   ->if you want to again start your Ec2 instance so select near test dropdown and slect startEC2 button and deploy 
    it and again hit test buton you will see your instance are running right now
